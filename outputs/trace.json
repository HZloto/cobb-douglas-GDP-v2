    "reasoning": "The policy directly impacts the workforce and productivity across all sectors due to the broad nature of AI implementation. A negative impact on workforce is observed, with a positive impact in productivity. Workforce reduction of 30% by 2030 is implemented gradually. Gradual increase in productivity is assumed with the adoption of AI with an overall impact of 10%.",
