  "prompt": "Oil prices drop to 20 USD by 2030",
  "agent_output": {
    "reasoning": "The drop in oil prices significantly impacts Saudi Arabia's economy, necessitating adjustments across multiple sectors. The primary impact is on the mining sector (B), with reduced investments due to lower profitability. This decline affects related sectors like manufacturing (C), construction (F) and transportation (H). Workforce adjustments are also likely. The negative impact is staged over time, reflecting the gradual adaptation to the new price level. All regions are assumed to be impacted by this policy.",
