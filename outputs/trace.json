  "prompt": "Oil prices drop to 20 USD by 2030",
  "agent_output": {
    "reasoning": "A significant drop in oil prices will negatively impact Saudi Arabia's oil sector (B), leading to decreased investments and productivity. This will also affect related sectors like manufacturing (C) and transport (H) due to reduced demand and economic activity. The impact is spread across all regions (all) as oil revenue affects the entire nation. The magnitude of the impact is reflected in negative percentages for Investments and Productivity across these sectors. The impact is expected to be felt gradually over the years 2025-2030.",
