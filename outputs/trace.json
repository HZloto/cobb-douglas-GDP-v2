  "agent_output": {
    "reasoning": "Investment in transportation infrastructure directly affects the 'H' (transportation and storage) sector. Doubling investments by 2030 translates to a significant increase in Investments KPI. Furthermore, increased transportation efficiency boosts overall productivity, indirectly affecting manufacturing 'C' due to improved logistics and supply chains. The impact is phased in linearly from 2025 to 2030.",
