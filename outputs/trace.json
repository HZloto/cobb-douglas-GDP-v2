    "reasoning": "The tourism sector is primarily represented by 'I' (Accommodation & Food). A halving translates to a -50% impact. Mecca (MAK) is the specific region targeted. I've applied this to Workforce, as reduced tourism will directly affect employment, and to Investments, as it is likely to deter investments in this sector. The impact is distributed linearly from 2028 to 2030.",
